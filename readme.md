# C Hello worlds

You can find here a bunch of minature C programs to try get a little bit of a grasp of this lower level language.

All programs are built with mingw

Also some programs here that interact with windows.

Documentation is incredibly difficult to read for windows and tutorials are sparse. The wingui is basically a clone of the best resource I could find: the [transmission zero tutorial](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/computing/win32-apps-with-mingw/).
